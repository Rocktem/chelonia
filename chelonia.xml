		<description>
			<p class="indent">This amulet exudes a cold aura and chills to the touch. The jade rings that wrap around the body of the pendant coming to a halt as it approaches the onyx gem affixed to the center of the piece almost glows with a feeling of death. Lost souls that come near the pendant will lose a small part of themselves upon passing as the onyx gem absorbs and replicates parts of the undead's past. However, the gem, as if having consciousness, always returns the soul the part of them that they lost.</p>
			<p class="indent">Book One: Using the power of this gem, the attuned creature may take upon the form of any humanoid that has died within a minute near the gem or whose soul has come in contact with the pendant. As the form of the dead humanoid, you appear to others as how they looked before their death, that includes height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, clothes, and injuries. The user can appear as a different size or form than they originally were and will maintain knowledge of any fleeting memories that the humanoid once had. Those memories are limited to things the humanoid had thought of before death and events they remember as far as the day before they died.</p>
			<p class="indent">Book Two: Using the power of this gem, the attuned creature may use the power within a soul fragment to transfer a part of the soul's memory to another creature. Doing this will burn up the soul fragment within the gem. Charisma based checks using this ability can be made with advantage.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As you first wear the ring as its attuned creature, you recognize the color first shift into a dull grey from it's original clear coloration. Spending time with it, you tend to notice the ring shift in color, with differing words etched upon it for each shift in color. In due time, it is pretty easy to recognize that the ring shifts in the palette based on the emotions you feel and through contact with others they feel similar things to you.</p>
			<p class="indent">The ring essentially allows you to share your emotions with others through touch </p>
			<p class="indent">The following section will be updated as you further discover aspects of the ring. </p>
			<p class="indent">The following effects are what you've noted down occurs when the ring is of a certain color and word, as well as when you touch somebody with the hand the ring is on:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Name</td><td>Color</td><td>Emotion</td><td>Effect</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr><td>Merri</td><td>Yellow</td><td>Joy</td><td>While your hand is on them, they become boistrous and full of life</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Reger</td><td>Teal</td><td>Pity</td><td>While your hand is on them, they simply feel the pity that you feel for them.</td></tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Sloth</td><td>Orange</td><td>Tranquility</td>
						<td>
							<p>When used, it will apply the effects of “Calm Emotions” with a Spell save DC equal to the caster's spell save dc.</p>
							<p><b>Effects of Calm Emotions:</b></p>
							<p><i>Enchantment Spell</i></p>
							<p>The targeted creature must make a Charisma Saving throw, a creature can choose to fail the save if it wishes to do so.</p>
							<p>If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.</p>
							<p class="indent">1. You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.</p>
							<p class="indent">2. You can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.</p>
							<p>After the first touch, the effects linger for 30 seconds without concentration</p>

      <p>Water encircles your hand as you face your palm towards a point choose within range. As the water reaches the center of your palm, a giant sphere of water forms above the selected point and transforms into a massive goldfish. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, if the creature is of size medium or lower, they are restrained and in full cover. The goldfish remains on the field as an obstruction until attacked or until a round passes. When attacked or after 1 round, the goldfish turns back into water, spiraling into the form of a serpentine dragon. All creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the original point takes must make a dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. </p>

			<p>When you reach 3rd level, your realization of your alter ego assists in your acknowledgement of the weave, granting you the ability to cast spells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn three cantrips: message and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spell Slots.</i></b> The Alter Ego Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</i></b> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the transmutation and divination spells on the wizard spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Alter Ego Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a transmutation or divination spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a transmutation or divination spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through further experimentation on the capabilities of the weave. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
